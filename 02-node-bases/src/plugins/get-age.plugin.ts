/*
  Adapter Pattern is a pattern that allows you to use a different interface to the one that is provided.
  The Adapter Pattern is most useful when you need to:
  - Use a third-party library with a different interface than expected
  - Integrate legacy code with new systems
  - Standardize different interfaces across your application
  - Add error handling or data transformation to external APIs
  - Can easily swap 3rd party libraries with different interfaces and make the change just in the adapter
